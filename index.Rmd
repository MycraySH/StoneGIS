I am a sophomore at [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) , majoring in GIS. My hometown is [Gaobeidian, Hebei, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaobeidian), a small town with comfortable living quality.

[GEOG176A](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/geog176A) was my first Upper Division major course.In the short summer session, I had a preliminary understanding of the theories of geographic information science and R language.I am capable to apply and visualize spatial data. 

The instructor, [Mike Johnson](https://geog.ucsb.edu/graduate-students/) helped me a lot in his office hours. Using programming to analyze geographic data is a necessary skill for GIS practitioners.

Based on the knowledge I studied in GEOG176A, I completed some lab projects:
