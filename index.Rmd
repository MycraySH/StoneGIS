I am a sophomore at [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/) , majoring in GIS. My hometown is [Gaobeidian, Hebei, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaobeidian), a small town with comfortable living quality.
[GEOG176A](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/geog176A) was my first Upper Division major course.It is completely different from the lower division courses, and I am trying to overcome all the difficulties. The instructor, [Mike Johnson](https://geog.ucsb.edu/graduate-students/) helped me a lot in his office hours. Using programming to analyze geographic data is a necessary skill for GIS practitioners.
